# TITLE

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
* Microsoft - CoPilot is the feature that we are covering in this paper. 

* When was the company incorporated?
* CoPilot 

* Who are the founders of the company?

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
	* Office 365 which is branded as M365 or Microsoft 365 consisting of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams, and so on is the most widely used office application in the world. And now MS (Microsoft) has introduced AI capabilities to all these applications called CoPilot which is intended to increase productivity. Microsoft also has implemented these across other application stacks called Power Platform which has Power Apps, Power Automate, and Power Pages which are widely used business applications. They are promoted as no-code and low-code applications and promote citizen development, the term coined by Microsoft where business users or non-technical users can develop applications with ease. 
	* CoPilot is mainly introduced to increase the productivity of these applications. 
	* CoPilot is a generative AI tool built on Large Language Models and uses Natural Language to process the requests and perform the tasks. 
	* 


* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
* Microsoft created this feature for everyone who uses M365 applications for collaboration and increase productivity. 
* And for PowerPlatform application developers and creators, help them to increase productivity by suggesting the code, and helping them identify processes across their organization, create a pattern for citizen developers and so on.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

After OpenAI ChatGPT emerged every technology started to embed the generative AI in some shape or form into their portfolio. And Microsoft is also doing the same on their widely used applications both end users applications like M365 office tools and development community using PowerPlatform applications. 

We have Duet AI from Google which is a competitive feature to Microsoft’s  M365 CoPilot. Both Google’s G Suite and Microsoft’s M365 share the market on office applications, google has upper hand and their Duet AI is little ahead of CoPilot. Google Duet AI is more innovative for the content creators and Microsoft CoPilot is mostly used for business users using office applications. 


But Microsoft’s Power Platform CoPilot is something new to developers and creators, who are already getting wide assistance from ChatGPT. The CoPilot helps to develop business applications more faster and efficiently. As per Microsoft, CoPilot is the first generative AI capability used in any of the CRM or ERP applications.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

With Microsoft being one of the top companies both financially and innovative, I want them to invest more in research with quantum computing using AI applications. It will help to go way ahead with the medical field and climate exploration. 


* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
Both Medical and Climate (environmental) studies require more studies and predictions.  The combination of AI and quantum computing will make this research faster and help to provide better medical treatments and get prepared for natural calamities. 


* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
Quantum Computing and AI. 


* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
* Many AI applications, such as planning and scheduling, can benefit from quantum computing because it helps explore viable solutions to problems. AI architectures can be developed more efficiently and at a larger scale using quantum computers.
